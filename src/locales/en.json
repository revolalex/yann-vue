    "Biographie.Portrait.First_paragraph_part3" :"the eye tracked down by an injured hawk, that of a distracted pigeon, of a sparrow insolent, a patient heron, a swan in majesty or a dragonfly aristocratic of Bagatelle. « The sharpness of the eye, for me, is primordial », explains the photographer.",
    "Biographie.Portrait.First_paragraph_part4": "This sharpness is the key to its sincerity. Yann Crochet shows us that nature is staring at us, that it scrutinizes us in the eyes of a wild boar from the Compiègne forest, a young deer from Chantilly or a blackbird, Cour Saint-Emilion.",

    "Biographie.Portrait.Fourth_paragraph": "Exalting the biodiversity of nature in all its wild beauty is an essential component of sustainable development."
